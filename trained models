You can download random forest model from https://pan.baidu.com/s/13kKIim07DB1dK4u3PVDwEA?pwd=v7ri Extraction code: v7ri
You can download 2.5D U-Net++ model from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1I5KT2jE9iOWe6IXcT8YhRQ?pwd=r53d Extraction code: r53d
You can download other model from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KMGCXIOFflFwrsFWxZI_eA?pwd=c53b Extraction code: c53b
One thing needs to pay attention (r means the model has been trained after random forest model)
